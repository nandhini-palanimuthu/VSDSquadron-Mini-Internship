Overview:

A simple RISC processor with a UART interface is ideal for embedded systems and educational projects.
The RISC architecture, known for its reduced instruction set, offers simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for low-power and high-performance applications.
The UART interface facilitates serial communication, enabling data exchange between the processor and other devices, such as sensors or computers.
The key components used are RISC Processor Core: Includes ALU, registers, instruction fetch and decode units, and memory interface and UART Interface: Comprises TX and RX lines, baud rate generator, and buffers for serial communication.
Mainly used in applications like,
Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers and IoT devices for home automation, sensors, and robotics.
Education: Learning platforms and prototyping.
Industrial: Real-time control systems and data acquisition.
